notes:  Extract  As part of a prospective study to evaluate the efficacy of single annual doses of chemotherapy to control bancroftian filariasis (KAZURA et al., in press), a parasitological survey of approximately 2000 residents of the Dreikikir area was conducted in 1993, before administration of antifilarial medication. Amongst those evaluated for mf levels (by Nucleporea filtration of 1 mL of night blood samples) were 288 children aged 4-10 years, the mothers of 26 1 of them and the fathers of 2 10. Analysis of mf status among these groups using Mantel- Haenszel x2 statistics and Cornfield confidence intervals (Epi Info version 6, Centers for Disease Control, Atlanta, Georgia, USA) showed that both children of mf+ mothers and those of mf+ fathers had a higher risk of being mf+ compared with offspring of mf- parents.
