title: First Technical Working Group Meeting on Lymphatic Filariasis Elimination Programmes in the Pacific Island Countries and Areas
organization: Western Health Organisation Western Pacific Region
notes: The Pacific Programme to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis began with 22 countries, of which 11 were classified as endemic for lymphatic filariasis (LF). Four of these countries have reached the elimination target of less than 1% LF antigenemia prevalence, and significant progress towards elimination has been made in at least five other countries. In June 2008, the Pacific Program to Eliminate LF held its first Technical Working Group (TWG) meeting in Nadi, Fiji. The meeting was attended by temporary advisors from the Pacific, international experts and the WHO. The TWG meeting followed on from recommendations made in 2007 to conduct technically strong surveys in a number of countries. The data from these surveys guided the discussions of the TWG in identifying and addressing technical issues and developing country action plans for the next three years. These outcomes were achieved through a combination of presentations from the participants and group work.
