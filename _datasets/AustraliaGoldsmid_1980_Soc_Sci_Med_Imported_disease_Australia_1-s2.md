title: Imported disease  a continuing and increasing threat to Australia
organization: Goldsmid, J.M.
notes: This paper traces the background to the problem of imported diseases in Australia with especial reference to increasing population movements, especially to and from the tropics. Imported disease manifests itself in Australia in two ways  as a diagnostic and therapeutic problem on the one hand and as a transmission and public health problem on the other. The possibility of the introduction of schistosomiasis and the re-introduction of malaria and filariasis into the warmer parts of the country is considered. The final discussion revolves around what could and should be done here to protect both the individual and the community from this continuing and increasing threat of imported disease.
