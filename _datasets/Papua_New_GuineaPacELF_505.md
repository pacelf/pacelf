title: The prevalence of naturally acquired multiple infections of Wuchereria bancrofti and human malarias in anophelines
organization: Burkot, T.R., Paru, R., Dagoro, H., Garner, P.
notes: Malaria and filaria infection rates were determined for anopheline mosquitoes collected whilst biting and resting in village houses in Papua New Guinea. The number of anophelines infected with both parasites was greater than expected from the infection rates of each parasite and this difference was significant in resting collections. The excess of multiply infected mosquitoes is probably a result of a vector population composed of individuals with differing numbers of opportunities to become infected. Malaria-positive Anopheles punctulatus from resting catches had a significantly greater number of Stage 3 Wuchereria bancrofti larvae than malaria-negative mosquitoes. However, multiply infected mosquitoes appear to suffer greater mortality than non-infected or singly infected mosquitoes when the filarial worm reaches the third stage. Any potential increase in transmission resulting from multiple infections is thereby offset by a greater mortality rate in these mosquitoes.
