title: Vectors of Wuchereria bancrofti in the Sepik Provinces of Papua New Guinea
organization: Bryan, J.H.
notes: The vectors of Wuchereria bancrofti were investigated in two areas of the Sepik Provinces of Papua New Guinea. At the village of Yauatong, indoor-resting Anopheles punctulatus had an infection rate of 47.3% and an infective rate of 3.4%. No infections occurred in 382 Culex annulirostris obtained in night-landing catches. At the village of Yankok only An. koliensis contained infective larvae but An. punctulatus and Cx quinquefasciatus were infected. Probit values of the cumulative percentages of filariae-positive mosquitoes plotted against the logarithm of the corresponding filaria count are illustrated.
