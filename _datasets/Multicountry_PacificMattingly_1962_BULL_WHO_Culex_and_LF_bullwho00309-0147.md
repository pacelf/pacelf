title: Some considerations relating to the role of Culex pipiens fatigans Wiedemann in the transmission of human filariasis
organization: Mattingly, P.F.
notes: This paper is concerned mainly with the relationship between microfilarial periodicity and vector periodicity. The so-called "non-periodic" Pacific form of Wuchereria bancrofti in fact shows a well-marked and relatively constant periodicity. The amplitude of this periodicity is low, which may account for the difficulty of detecting it in small clinical samples. The periodicity is well adapted to the biting cycle of Aedes polynesiensis, though less so than that of the "semi-periodic" Brugia malayi to forest Mansonioides. Microfilarial periodicity is discussed in the light of recent work on circadian rhythms in other animals and it is suggested that certain possibilities have been given insufficient weight. The use of the term "migration" to describe microfilarial translocation within the host may have given rise to misunderstanding but it is in good agreement with current concepts of migration. Recent work suggests some behavioural heterogeneity in Culex fatigans which could render it a useful mosquito for elucidating certain important but little-understood problems.
