title: Lymphatic filariasis elimination in the Pacific  PacELF replicating Japanese success
organization: Ichimori, K., Graves, P.M., Crump, A.
notes: Japan successfully eliminated lymphatic filariasis and other parasitic diseases through community-driven, integrated nationwide campaigns undertaken during the 1960s and 1970s. The campaigns also created a cadre of experienced clinicians, scientists and public health workers with excellent technical and operational knowledge and a positive attitude towards filariasis elimination. These factors, and the humanitarian desire to improve health in neighbouring nations, influenced Japan to support filariasis control efforts overseas, starting in the 1970s and continuing through to the inception of the Pacific Programme to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis (PacELF) in 1999. The unique community-driven, self-help approach of Japan to disease control and health improvement profoundly influenced the activities of PacELF. PacELF is demonstrating that the successful national disease-elimination model in Japan can be extended to the regional level.
