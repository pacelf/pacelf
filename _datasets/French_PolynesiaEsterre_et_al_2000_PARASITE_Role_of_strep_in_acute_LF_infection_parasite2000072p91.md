title: Role of streptococcal infection in the acute pathology of lymphatic filariasis
organization: Esterre, P., Plichart, C., Huin-Blondey, M.O., Nguyen, L.
notes: Growing evidence suggest that secondary bacteriol, mainly streptococcal, infections contribute significantly to recurrent episodes of acute adenolymphangitis (ADL) of filarial origin. We examined the role of group A streptococci in the progression of lymphedema in Polynesian patients with filariasis-related ADL (22 cases) or chronic pathology (10 cases), or with erysipela (10 patients) and, as controls, in 20 healthy adults. Antistreptolysin O (ASLO) and anti-streptodornase B (ASDB) titers were systematically determined in parallel to parasitological and biochemical tests. ASLO and ASDB assays were positive in 100 % of erysipela, 75 % of filarial ADL as compared ro 50 % of chronic pathology and 39 % of healthy controls. interestingly, by opposition to ASLO liters which were not significantly different between the four groups, ASDB titers were higher in ADL (p = 0.0101 and erysipela (p = 0.002) than in controls. These results support the hypothesis that recurrent streptococcal infections may have an important role in the pathogenesis of ADL in lymphatic filariasis.
