title: The natural decline of Wuchereria bancrofti infection in a vector control situation in the Solomon Islands
organization: Webber, R.H.
notes: In a situation where filariasis and malaria are transmitted by the same vector, as seen here in the Solomon Islands, the Malaria Eradication Programme aimed at controlling the vector, was found to have an effect on both diseases. In an area of Choiseul island first surveyed by the author in 1970, three follow-up surveys were conducted--in 1974, 1975 and 1976. These showed a progressive decrease in persons infected. When the densities, especially the median microfilarial counts, were expressed as percentage values of the pre-spray survey, there was found to be a proportional decrease over eight years. It is possible that the Anopheline vector needs to be reduced less for the cessation of transmission of filariasis than for malaria. A theoretical ratio was calculated and supporting field evidence presented.
