organization: Mahon, R.J., Miethke, P.M.
notes: A hitherto unrecognized mosquito species, Anopheles farauti No. 3 has been found in Australia. This species occurs in sympatry with both A. farauti No. 1 and A. farauti No. 2 but we have found no evidence of introgression. Hybrids between A. farauti No. 3 and either A. farauti No. 1 or A. farauti No. 2 were found to be sterile.
