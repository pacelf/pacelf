title: The ICT filariasis test  A rapid-format antigen test for diagnosis of bancroftian filariasis
organization: Weil, G.J., Lammie, P.J., Weiss, N.
notes: Antigen testing is now recognized as the method of choice for detection of Wuchereria bancrofti infections. Unlike tests that detect microfilariae, antigen tests can be performed with blood collected during the day or night. However, existing enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) tests for filarial antigenemia are difficult to perform in the field, and this has limited their use in endemic countries. In this article, Gary Weil, Patrick Lammie and Niggi Weiss review their experience with a new rapid-format filarial antigen test. They found that the ICT card test was very easy to perform and that it was comparable with ELISA for the detection of filarial antigen in sera from people with microfilaremia. The introduction now of an antigen test suitable for use in the field is especially timely, in that it may facilitate implementation of new strategies proposed by the World Health Organization for control and elimination of lymphatic filariasis.
