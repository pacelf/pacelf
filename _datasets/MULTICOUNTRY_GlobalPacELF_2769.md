title: Defining the Roles of Vector Control and Xenomonitoring in the Global Programme to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis
organization: World Health Organization
notes: Overview  The consultation was convened to assess the potential value of vector control to augment the Global Programme to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis (GPELF), a mosquito-borne disease affecting about 120 million people in 80 countries. The meeting also provided an opportunity to consider the possible role of monitoring filariasis prevalence in the human population via vector sampling and assays. The term xenomonitoring was introduced for this approach. The GPELF was launched in 2000, based on two strategies  stopping transmission and alleviation of disability due to the disease. Currently the GPELF depends largely on mass drug administration (MDA) to interrupt transmission of filaria parasites  Brugia and Wuchereria bancrofti. Integrated vector control activities and environmental sanitation are encouraged while national ELF programmes focus primarily on achieving high rates of MDA coverage.
