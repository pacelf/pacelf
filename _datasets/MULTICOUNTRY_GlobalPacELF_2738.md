title: Eliminate Filariasis  Attack poverty - the global alliance to eliminate lymphatic filariasis
organization: World Health Organization
notes: Overview  By all accounts, the first meeting of the Global Alliance to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis convened in Santiago de Compostela, Spain on 4-5 May 2000, was a success. It more than fulfilled its stated goals to review progress in the 18 months since the previous Partnersí Meeting in October 1998, to strengthen the existing Alliance, to seek creative ways to stimulate financial and other support in order to ìreach the first 200 million people at risk by the end of 2004. Overall, more than 25 presentations were made to some 70 participants at the meeting (see list of participants in the Annex). Following the welcoming ceremony and completion of organizational matters, a global overview of the disease and its links to poverty was presented, followed by reports and recommendations from the first meeting of the Technical Advisory Group on the Global Elimination of Lymphatic Filariasis (2-3 May 2000) and the Programme Review Group.
