title: Lymphatic filariasis in Papua New Guinea  distribution at district level and impact of mass drug administration, 1980 to 2011
organization: Graves, P.M., Makita, L., Susapu, M., Brady, M.A., Melrose, W., Capuano, C., Zhang, Z., Dapeng, L., Ozaki, M., Reeve, D., Ichimori, K., Kazadi, W.M., Michna, F., Bockarie, M.J., Kelly-Hope, L.A.
notes: Background  Lymphatic filariasis (LF) caused by Wuchereria bancrofti is present at high prevalence in some parts of Papua New Guinea. However, there has been no rigorous data-based representative assessment of nationwide prevalence of LF. The LF programme has been daunted by the scope of the problem, and progress on mass drug administration (MDA) has been slow and lacking in resources.
