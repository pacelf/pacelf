title: Wolbachia bacteria of filarial nematodes
organization: Taylor, M.J., Hoerauf, A.
notes: The finding that the intracellular bacteria of filarial nematodes are related to the Wolbachia symbionts of arthropods has generated great interest. Here, Mark Taylor and Achim Hoerauf review recent studies by several groups on the structure, distribution and phylogeny of these endosymbionts, and discuss the potential role for these bacteria in filarial disease and as a target for chemotherapy.
