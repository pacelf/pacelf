title: Aedes albopictus in the Solomon and Santa Cruz Islands,South Pacific
organization: Elliott, S.A.
notes: Surveys of mosquitoes in the South Pacific up until 1977 have shown the presence of Aedes albopictus only as far east as Papua New Guinea. During the visit to the Solomon Islands in 1978 to collect members of the Aedes (Stegomyia) scutellaris complex, Ae. albopictus was found in large numbers on Guadalcanal and was also present in the Santa Cruz Islands. This species has been incriminated as a vector of dengue haemorrhagic fever.
