title: Managing morbidity and preventing disability in the Global Programme to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis
organization: World Health Organization
notes: National elimination programmes should focus on managing morbidity and preventing disability in order to achieve the objectives of the global programme, which include providing care to those already affected by lymphatic filariasis even after transmission has been interrupted. Patients who experience various clinical and social consequences of the disease have a right to health care, and national programmes must make this right a reality.
