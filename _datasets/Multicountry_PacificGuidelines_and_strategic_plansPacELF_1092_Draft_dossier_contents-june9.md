title: Procedures for verification of the absence of transmission of lymphatic filariasis (draft)
organization: No authors available.
notes: Currently, the World Health Organization (WHO) considers 83 countries endemic for lymphatic filariasis. In some of these countries, recent evidence suggests that transmission may have been interrupted. This document 1) outlines a proposed process for international verification of the interruption of transmission of lymphatic filariasis from formerly-endemic countries; and 2) provides a proposed format for the dossier that must be submitted by the Ministry of Health (MoH) of formerly-endemic countries to request official verification from WHO.
