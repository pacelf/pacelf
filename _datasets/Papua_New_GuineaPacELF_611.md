title: The anopheline fauna of Papua New Guinea
organization: Cooper, R.D., Waterson, D.G.E., Frances, S.P., Beebe, N.W., Sweeney, A.W.
notes: Surveys for anopheline mosquitoes were conducted throughout the mainland of Papua New Guinea from 1992 to 1998 with the aim of mapping the distribution of the anopheline fauna. Larval collections, adult trap, and human landing collections indicated the presence of seven species (other than those belonging to the Anopheles punctulatus group); these were An. bancroftii, An. annulipes, An. karwari, An. longirostris, An. meraukensis, An. novaguinensis, and An. subpictus. The distribution and ecology of these species is discussed.
