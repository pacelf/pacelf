title: Og4C3 circulating antigen  a marker of infection and adult worm burden in Wuchereria bancrofti filariasis
organization: Chanteau, S., Moulia-Pelat, J.P., Glaziou, P., Nguyen, N.L., Luquiaud, P., Plichart, C., Martin, P.M.V., Cartel, J.L.
notes: Og4C3 circulating filarial antigen was detected in the sera of 94.5% (259/274) of microfilaremic patients, 32% (239/751) of persons with presumption of filariasis, and 23% (11/48) of chronic filariasis patients. The antigen level was correlated with the microfilariae (Mf) density and patient age (P < .01). It remained stable in patients treated with microfilaricidal drugs. Og4C3 antigen, undetectable in Mf culture media, was demonstrated to be a rare somatic Mf antigen. It appears to be an excreted or secreted antigen from adult filaria. It could be used as a marker of infection and an indicator of adult worm burden.
