title: Polymorphic microsatellite loci in the mosquito Aedes polynesiensis
organization: Behbahani, A., Dutton, T.J., Raju, A.K., Townson, H., Sinkins, S.P.
notes: The Aedes scutellaris complex of mosquitoes contains the most important vectors of lymphatic filariasis in the South Pacific region, particularly Aedes polynesiensis. Six microsatellite loci were isolated and characterized from this species; all were polymorphic and appear to be useful markers for population studies. Five of the primer pairs also amplified homologous products from three other species in the A. scutellaris group and from the important dengue vector Aedes albopictus.
