title: The PacELF programme  will mass drug administration be enough?
organization: Burkot, T., Ichimori, K.
notes: The Pacific Programme to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis is a regional, mass drug administration-based campaign in 22 countries and territories with the aim of eliminating filariasis transmission and alleviating the suffering caused by Wuchereria bancrofti. The challenges to filariasis elimination campaigns based on mass drug-administration alone are reviewed in this article. These challenges together with the previous successes of mosquito control campaigns in eliminating filariasis from regions in the Pacific argue for inclusion of entomology components in the control of filariasis and the monitoring of filariasis elimination programs.
