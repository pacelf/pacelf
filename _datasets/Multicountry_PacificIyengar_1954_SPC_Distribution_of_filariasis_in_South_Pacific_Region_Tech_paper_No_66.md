title: Distribution of filariasis in the South Pacific Region
organization: Iyengar, M.O.T.
notes: Introduction  Various investigations in filariasis have been carried out in different parts of the South Pacific region. The results of the majority of these have appeared in numerous scientific periodicals, while many of them are confined to official reports and other records not easily accessible to a worker. The need was felt for collating all the data and presenting the available information in the form of maps so as to give a bird's-eye view of teh different aspects of filariasis in the region.
