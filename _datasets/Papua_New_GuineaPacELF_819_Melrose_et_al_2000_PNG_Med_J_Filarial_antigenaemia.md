title: Prevalence of filarial antigenaemia in Papua New Guinea  Results of surveys by the School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine, James Cook University, Townsville, Australia
organization: Melrose, W., Pisters, P., Turner, P., Kombati, Z., Selve, B.P., Hii, J., Speare, R.
notes: During the period from 1991 to 1997 the School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine, James Cook University carried out filariasis surveys in several parts of Papua New Guinea using the newly introduced Onchocerca gibsoni monoclonal (Og4C3) and immunochromatographic test (ICT) antibody-based assays for filarial antigen and, in some cases, a Knott's test for microfilariae. The average prevalence of filarial antigenaemia and microfilaraemia was 56% and 35% respectively confirming earlier survey results that filariasis is hyperendemic in many parts of the country. The antigen tests detected 25% more cases than the Knott's test and the simplicity of the ICT and its capacity to produce almost instant results make it an ideal tool for surveys.
