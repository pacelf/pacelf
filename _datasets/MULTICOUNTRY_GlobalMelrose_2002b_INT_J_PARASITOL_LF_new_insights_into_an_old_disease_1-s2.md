title: Lymphatic filariasis  new insights into an old disease
organization: Melrose, W.D.
notes: Lymphatic filariasis has afflicted people in the tropical areas of the world for thousands of years but even up to comparatively recent times it has been poorly understood and its importance under recognised. In the last 2 decades or so there has been a flurry of activity in filariasis research, which has provided new insights into the global problem of filariasis, the pathogenesis of filarial disease, diagnosis and control.
