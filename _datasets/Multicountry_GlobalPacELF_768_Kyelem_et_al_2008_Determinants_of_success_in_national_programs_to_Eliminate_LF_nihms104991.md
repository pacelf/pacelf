title: Determinants of success in national programs to eliminate lymphatic filariasis  A perspective identifying essential elements and research needs
organization: Kyelem, D., Biswas, G., Bockarie, M.J., Bradley, M.H., El-Setouhy, M., Fischer, P.U., Henderson, R.H., Kazura, J.W., Lammie, P.J., Njenga, S.M., Ottesen, E.A., Ramaiah, K.D., Richards, F.O., Weil, G.J., Williams, S.A.
notes: The Global Programme to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis (GPELF) was launched in 2000. To understand why some national programs have been more successful than others, a panel of individuals with expertise in LF elimination efforts met to assess available data from programs in 8 countries. The goal was to identify  1) the factors determining success for national LF elimination programs (defined as the rapid, sustained reduction in microfilaremia/antigenemia after repeated mass drug administration  MDA )  2) the priorities for operational research to enhance LF elimination efforts.
