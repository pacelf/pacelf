title: Epidemiological assessment of continuing transmission of lymphatic filariasis in Samoa
organization: Joseph, H., Maiava, F., Naseri, T., Silva, U., Lammie, P., Melrose, W.
notes: Ongoing transmission of lymphatic filariasis (LF) was assessed in five Samoan villages by measuring microfilaraemia (Mf), circulating filarial antigen (CFA) and antibody prevalence. Compared to the other villages, Fasitoo-Tai had a significantly higher Mf prevalence (3.2%), CFA prevalence (14.6%) and antibody prevalence in children (62.0%) (P<0.05). Puapua had a significantly lower CFA prevalence (2.5%), no detectable Mf-positive individuals and significantly low antibody prevalence in children (7.9%) (P<0.05). Siufaga, previously believed to be LF-free, recorded >1% CFA prevalence and a high antibody prevalence in children (46.6%). Overall, antibody prevalence in children appeared to reflect the transmission dynamics in the villages and, in Siufaga, identified an area of ongoing transmission. The Filariasis Cellabs Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (CELISA), based on recombinant antigen Bm14, to detect antibodies, could potentially be a promising diagnostic tool for inclusion in future surveillance in the South Pacific.
