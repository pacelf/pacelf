title: Detection and characterization of Wolbachia infections in Wuchereria bancrofti (Spirurida  Onchocercidae) var. pacifica and Aedes (Stegomyia) polynesiensis (Diptera  Culicidae)
organization: Plichart, C., Legrand, A.-M.
notes: Despite control programs based on mass drug administration (MDA) of microfilaricidal compounds, Bancroftian lymphatic filariasis remains a problem in French Polynesia. For an alternative strategy to MDA, we investigated the potential role of Wolbachia to control filarial transmission. Wolbachia are intracellular alpha-proteobacteria endosymbionts that infect a broad range of insects and nematodes. These bacteria have a suspected role in the pathogenesis of filariasis. They also may be useful in mosquito control through cytoplasmic incompatibility. To detect and characterize these bacteria in the filarial and mosquito-vectors in French Polynesia, a survey was conducted on field-collected mosquitoes and microfilariae from infected people. Samples were analyzed by a polymerase chain reaction and gene sequencing. The results indicate that these bacteria are widespread. Sequence analysis of the wsp and ftsZ genes positioned the Aedes polynesiensis Wolbachia in cluster A and Wuchereria bancrofti var. pacifica Wolbachia in cluster D. The implications for possible improved treatment and vector control are discussed.
