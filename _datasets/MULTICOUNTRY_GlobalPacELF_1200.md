notes: Overview  This document is a guideline for managers for planning and establishing a programme for the elimination of lymphatic filariasis. It is intended for use by national programme managers, programme officials and consultants to the ministries of health in countries where lymphatic filariasis is known, or suspected, to be endemic, but not for use in countries where onchocerciasis is co-endemic with lymphatic filariasis or where the use of diethylcarba-mazine citrate (DEC) is contraindicated. National Programme managers of these countries may consult the respective guideline relevant to onchocerciasis co-endemic countries. The epidemiology and clinical manifestations of lymphatic filariasis are not described in this document as extensive information on the subject is readily available elsewhere.
