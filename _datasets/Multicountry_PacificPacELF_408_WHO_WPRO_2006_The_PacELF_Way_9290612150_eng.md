title: The PacELF Way - towards the elimination of LF from the Pacific 1999 - 2005
organization: World Health Organization, Western Pacific Region
notes: The PacELF Way  Towards the Elimination of Lymphatic Filariasis from the Pacific, 1999-2005 records the intense commitment and cooperation of the member countries of the Pacific Programme to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis (PacELF) in its first six years. It presents evidence of the noteworthy impact and success achieved halfway through the programme, and points out the challenges that still remain. We hope that community leaders, field staff, programme managers, policy-making and planning officers, health professionals, scientists, and students interested in lymphatic filariasis elimination and disease control programmes in general will find this book useful in programme implementation, strategic planning and research. The world has much to learn from the lessons in international cooperation and management in the Pacific contained in this book. The PacELF Way shows that the people involved, their motivation and active participation, are the key to eliminating this communicable disease. PacELF owes its success to collaboration between small island countries separated by a vast ocean, working towards a common goal.
