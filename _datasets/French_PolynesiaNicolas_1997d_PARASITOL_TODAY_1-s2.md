title: New tools for diagnosis and monitoring of bancroftian filariasis parasitism  the Polynesian experience
organization: Nicolas, L.
notes: Bancroftian filariasis is endemic in French Polynesia and control programs with diethylcarbamazine, started in the 1950s, led to a sharp reduction of the microfilaria prevalence. Consequently, the control program was interrupted in 1982. Ten years later, however, the incidence of the parasitism again reached pre-control levels (20-30% microfilaremia in some islands), indicating that the adult worms (for which no diagnostic tool was available) had persisted. Apart from research on chemotherapy strategies, the Institut Malarde has been actively involved in developing and evaluating more-powerful diagnostic tools than the unique detection of microfilariae by blood smear examination. These include  (1) the detection of adult worm circulating antigens in humans, and (2) the detection of Wuchereria bancrofti larvae in mosquitoes, using DNA probes. In this paper, Luc Nicolas reviews the available diagnostic tools to detect W. bancrofti and their implementation in epidemiological areas, based on the Polynesian experience.
