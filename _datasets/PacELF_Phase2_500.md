title: Lymphatic filariasis elimination  A public health opportunity
organization: Molyneux, D.
notes: No public health programme has expanded as quickly as the Global Programme to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis (GPELF). Governments in endemic regions increasingly view the programme as a tangible way to address poverty and improve health. The mission of the Global Alliance to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis (GAELF) is to bring together a group of international public-private health partners to support GPELF by mobilising political, financial and technical resources to ensure success, and to raise public awareness of LF as a debilitating and disabling poverty-related disease that is eliminable.
