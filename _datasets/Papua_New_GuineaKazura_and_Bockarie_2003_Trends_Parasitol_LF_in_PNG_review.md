title: Lymphatic filariasis in Papua New Guinea  interdisciplinary research on a national health problem
organization: Kazura, J.W., Bockarie, M.J.
notes: Bancroftian filariasis is a major public health problem in Papua New Guinea, where the level of transmission by the mosquito vector, human infection rates and clinical morbidity are among the highest in the world. Coordinated research efforts within the country, involving the disciplines of epidemiology, vector biology, immunology and genetics, have led to new insights into the ecology and pathogenesis of human lymphatic filariasis. Recent work using this knowledge base should be helpful in assessing local and global strategies aimed at eliminating Wuchereria bancrofti and in guiding research that will facilitate achievement of this goal.
