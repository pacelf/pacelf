title: Long-term efficacy of single-dose mass treatment with diethylcarbamazine citrate against diurnally subperiodic Wuchereria bancrofti  eight years' experience in Samoa

notes: A single-dose of diethylcarbamazine citrate (DEC, 6 mg per kg body weight) was administered in three mass treatment campaigns to >80% of the estimated total Samoan population (160 000) in 1982, 1983, and 1986. The effect of the drug was evaluated before and after each campaign by conducting four blood surveys covering 9600 to 13 700 people from 26-34 villages on each occasion. The drug reduced the prevalence of Wuchereria bancrofti microfilariae from 5.6% to 2.5% (a 55% reduction), while the transmission potential (the estimated mosquito infection rate if everyone is equally exposed to mosquito bites) dropped from 2.18 to 0.67 (a 70% reduction). The total number of microfilariae in the Samoan population is estimated to have been reduced by 80%. A spaced, single-dose treatment with DEC at a 1-2-year interval therefore seems to be an effective control measure against diurnally subperiodic W. bancrofti.
