title: Bancroftian filariasis in an isolated hunter-gatherer shifting horticulturist group in Papua New Guinea
organization: Desowitz, R.S., Jenkins, C., Anian, G.
notes: A survey for Wuchereria bancrofti microfilaraemia using membrane filtration was carried out among the Hagahai, a recently contacted Papua New Guinea group of hunter-gatherer shifting horticulturists, Adult men had a significantly higher microfilaraemia rate than women. Children aged > 15 years had significantly fewer infections than adults and the microfilaraemia densities were considerably lower. Two subjects exhibited matutinal microfilarial periodicity, peaking at approximately 06 h 00. The possible reasons for the epidemiological and microfilarial findings are discussed.
