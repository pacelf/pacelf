title: The role of albendazole in programmes to eliminate lymphatic filariasis
organization: Ottesen, E.A., Ismail, M.M., Horton, J.
notes: Citing earlier advances in the treatment of lymphatic filariasis  particularly the effectiveness of single-dose diethylcarbamazine (DEC) in reducing microfilaraemia and its enhanced effectiveness when co-administered with single-dose ivermectin , Eric Ottesen, Mahroof Ismail and John Horton consider recent studies on the antifilarial activity of albendazole that have led to the current recommendations for its use in single-dose regimens in conjunction with either DEC or ivermectin for large-scale control/elimination programmes. Furthermore, the potential of albendazole as a macrofilaricide for treating individual patients with lymphatic filarial infections is emphasized as one of a number of important research questions that remain to be explored.
