title: Evaluation of the program to eliminate lymphatic filariasis in Vanuatu following two years of mass drug administration implementation  results and methodologic approach
organization: Fraser, M., Taleo, G., Taleo, F., Yaviong, J., Amos, M., Babu, M., Kalkoa, M.
notes: This report presents the results of the Vanuatu mid-term evaluation of the lymphatic filariasis elimination program being implemented countrywide. Vanuatu is one of the first countries to initiate this program as part of the Global Program for Elimination of Lymphatic Filariasis, based on a five-year annual mass drug administration (MDA) of albendazole and diethylcarbamazine and complemented in Vanuatu by extensive coverage with bed nets. This paper reports results of 561 persons tested at eight sentinel sites following two years of MDA. Coverage was 72% and bed net use was more than 70%. Antigen prevalence was reduced by 63% (from 22% to 8%) and prevalence of microfilaremia prevalence was reduced by 93% (from 12% to 0.8%). Results of surveys of health workers and the community are also reported, and the methodology used for this evaluation is discussed.
