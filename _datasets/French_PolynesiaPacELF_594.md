title: Efficiency of papain-treated microfilariae of Wuchereria bancrofti (var. pacifica) as antigen for serodiagnosis of bancroftian filariasis in French Polynesia
organization: Chanteau, S., Guid, C., Durosoir, J.L.
notes: Papain-treated microfilariae of Wuchereria bancrofti have been used as antigen for indirect fluorescent assay  0% of non-endemic sera, 8% of healthy exposed Polynesians, 48% of clinical patients and 96% of microfilaraemic subjects were positive by this test. The geometric mean titres were 22, 41, 147 and 605 respectively. Untreated microfilariae were unsuitable for diagnostic purposes. Dirofilaria immitis adult sections showed low reactivity, giving poor discrimination between non-endemic and microfilaraemic sera. The geometric mean titres were 6 and 61 respectively.
