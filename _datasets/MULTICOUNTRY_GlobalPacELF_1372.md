title: Transmission assessment surveys in the Global Programme to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis  WHO position statement
organization: World Health Organization
notes: Overview  In 1997, the 50th World Health Assembly resolved to eliminate lymphatic filariasis as a public health problem. In response, WHO established the Global Programme to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis (GPELF) to assist Member States in achieving this goal by 2020. The global programme has 2 components  (i) to reduce prevalence of infection to levels at which it is assumed that transmission can no longer be sustained and (ii) to manage morbidity and prevent disability.
