title: Editorial  The Global Programme to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis
organization: Ottesen, E.
notes: Ten years ago, no one foresaw that in the year 2000 there would be a Global Programme to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis (GPELF) that is already 2 years old, active in 18 of the 80 endemic countries, and operating under a wholly new paradigm in public health - a paradigm affirming that public/private sector partnerships are essential in sharing both responsibilities and responses to global health problems. What has driven the LF Elimination Programme to this point? Where it is now headed? What will be required to sustain its momentum? What will its impact be? These are the issues addressed below.
