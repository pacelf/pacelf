title: The vectors of human infections by Wuchereria species in endemic areas and their biology.
organization: Raghavan, N.G.
notes: In this paper the author has compiled an up-to-date list of the principal natural vectors of human Wuchereria infections, arranged by zoogeographical regions and countries, and gives data on natural and experimental filarial infection rates in vectors in different parts of the world. As an aid to workers in areas where Wuchereria and Plasmodium infections co-exist, he also provides a list of anophelines as filarial vectors, including in this list the results of natural and experimental studies of Wuchereria infection both alone and in combination with malaria.
