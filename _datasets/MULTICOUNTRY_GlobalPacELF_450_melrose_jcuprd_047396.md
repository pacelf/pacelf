title: Lymphatic Filariasis  a review 1862-2002
organization: Melrose, W.
notes:  Extract  The purpose of this review is three fold  To provide a comprehensive source document which can be used to write educational and health promotional material on lymphatic filariasis; to provide a background for my own original research and to highlight areas which require further investigation in order to stimulate others to carry out further research on this fascinating disease. The filariasis literature is voluminous and this review does not purport to cover all available material. An attempt has been made to cover all the most important aspects of filarial parasites and disease, and to include some of the more obscure and often forgotten material, some of which needs to be revisited in the light of modern filariology.
