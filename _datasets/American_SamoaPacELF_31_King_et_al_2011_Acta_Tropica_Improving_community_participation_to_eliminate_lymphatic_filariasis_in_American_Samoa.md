title: Improving community participation to eliminate lymphatic filariasis in American Samoa
organization: King, J.D., Zielinski-Gutierrez, E., Pa'au, M., Lammie, P.
notes: In 2000, the American Samoa Department of Health initiated a campaign of annual mass drug administration (MDA) with albendazole and diethylcarbamazine (DEC) to eliminate transmission of filariasis. Drug coverage was well below prescribed targets in the first three campaigns, ranging from 24 to 52% of the total population. Evaluation findings from a variety of formative research methods identified opportunities to improve MDA coverage and ensuing program modifications resulted in increased drug coverage of 65-71% in the following four annual distributions. Partnering with churches for drug distribution and using multiple media channels for health promotion led to sustained program improvements. With the increased emphasis on the use of mass distribution for delivery of drugs for a number of neglected tropical diseases, other programs may benefit from a similar approach.
