title: Laboratory studies of Ochlerotatus samoanus in association with leaf axils of Freycinetia (Pandanaceae) in Samoa
organization: Uchida, K., Ichimori, K., Paulson, G.S., Cox, P.A., Sone, F., Samarawickrema, W.A.
notes: Three species of Freycinetia (Pandanaceae) (F. reineckei, F. storkii, and F. hombronii) were tested for oviposition preference of Ochlerotatus samoanus, a vector of filariasis in Samoa. Laboratory tests indicated that F. reineckei was preferred by this mosquito for oviposition. Eggs were preferentially deposited on a peeled or a moist dried leaf. The percentage hatch was highest when eggs were kept moist for longer than 4 days before submersion. Hatching was complete in less than 6 h. These studies allowed us to successfully rear Oc. samoanus in the laboratory, facilitating future studies on the biology and control of this important vector.
