title: Natural infection of Dirofilaria immitis in Aedes (Stegomyia) polynesiensis and Aedes (Finlaya) samoanus and their implication in human health in Samoa
organization: Samarawickrema, W.A., Kimura, E., Sones, F., Paulson, G.S., Cummings, R.F.
notes: Dirofilaria immitis infections were observed in Aedes polynesiensis and Ae. samoanus in Samoa, together with Wuchereria bancrofti infections, in a study on sub-periodic bancroftian filariasis during 1978-1980. In the 4 indicator villages, the infection rate in Ae. polynesiensis was 0.46% and the infective rate 0.09% (15 223 mosquitoes were dissected). The infection rate in Ae. samoanus was 0.20% and the infective rate 0.08% (10 089 dissected). In 45 selected villages throughout the country, Ae. polynesiensis infection and infective rates were 0.92% and 0.29% (7575 dissected) and the rates for Ae. samoanus were 0.21% and 0.07% (9093 dissected). Infection with D. immitis was comparable in degree and distribution to that with W. bancrofti. There was a steady and consistent exchange of parasites between the human and canine populations, creating conditions favourable for human dirofilariasis in Samoa. Clinicians are warned against this probable human infection.
