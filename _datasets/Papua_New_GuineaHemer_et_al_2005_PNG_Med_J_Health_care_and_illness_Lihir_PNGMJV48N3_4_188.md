title: Health care and illness in Lihir, New Ireland Province, in the context of the development of the Lihir gold mine
organization: Hemer, S.R.
notes: During 2000 a review of health care and illness in Lihir, New Ireland Province, was carried out while I was employed as a Community Health Research Officer with the Lihir Management Company, the manager of a gold mine on Lihir. The review aim was to document the health care providers for the local population and the illness burden suffered by Lihirians, and then to shape services to have a more preventive emphasis. It was discovered that the health care services available were well utilized by Lihirians. Health care was provided by the church, government and the mining company, and needed better coordination of services. Lihirians faced a relatively heavy burden of illness, with malaria the most common affliction. They also suffered significantly from lymphatic filariasis and tuberculosis, and children were poorly nourished. A considerable number of recommendations have been adopted since the health review to improve the health of, and delivery of health services to Lihirians.
