title: Eradication of Wuchereria bancrofti infection through vector control
organization: Webber, R.H.
notes:  Extract  Attempts at vector control of bancroftian filariasis have generally met with little or no success, but in the Solomon Islands, where Anopheline vector control has been continued over a long period as part of the Malaria Eradication Programme, WEBBER (1977) has recently reported that a proportional decline was noted of the median microfilarial density over a period of six and a half years, projecting that zero density would be reached in December 1976. This paper reports on follow-up surveys conducted in the same are to find out what actually happened.
