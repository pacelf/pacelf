title: Bancroftian filariasis  new understanding and strategies for control
organization: Nicolas, L.
notes: Lymphatic filariasis affects more than 120 million people in tropical countries and is considered the second most widespread cause of physical and social handicap. The development of both new, sensitive tools for monitoring filarial parasitism in communities, and of simple chemotherapy strategies raises the hopes of public health professionals for the elimination of this parasitic disease.
