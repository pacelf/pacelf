title: Human host selection by anophelines  no evidence for preferential selection of malaria or microfilariae-infected individuals in a hyperendemic area
organization: Burkot, T.R., Graves, P.M., Narara, A., Paru, R., Garner, P.
notes: Host selection among humans by Anopheles punctulatus was studied in an area of Papua New Guinea endemic for malaria and filariasis. Blood films were made from the stomach contents of freshly engorged mosquitoes found resting on the walls of houses in which the parasite status of the occupants was known. Engorgement rates on humans were non-random but could not be consistently related to the parasite status of individuals in the houses for either malaria or filaria. In some households, anophelines preferentially fed on parasitaemic individuals while in other households aparasitaemic individuals were significantly more often selected. This finding is believed to reflect the fact that malaria and filarial infections in this endemic area are predominantly asymptomatic. There were no significant differences in axillary temperatures between malaria or microfilariae positive or negative individuals.
