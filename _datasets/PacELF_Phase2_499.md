notes: Preventive chemotherapy is the public health strategy recommended by the WHO against a set of neglected tropical diseases that includes four groups of helminth infections (lymphatic filariasis, onchocerciasis, schistosomiasis and soil-transmitted helminthiasis) and one chlamydial (trachoma) infection. This article presents the characteristics of preventive chemotherapy interventions directed against each disease targeted by this strategy and provides an update on the status of their implementation worldwide.
