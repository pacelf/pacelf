Ancestral beliefs are still widely held even after 25 years of antifilarial campaigns which have resulted in a drastic decrease in endemicity with almost no clinical incidence. It is disappointing that the responsibility of mosquitoes is denied by a majority of patients. The explanations are to be found in the unusual evolution of this disease and in the small importance attached to sanitary education.</description><year>1979</year><authors>Carme, B., Utahia, A., Tuira, E., Teuru, T.</authors><journal>Transactions of the Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene</journal><volume-issue>73(4)</volume-issue><pages>424-426</pages><work_location>French Polynesia</work_location><language>English</language><access_rights>Restricted</access_rights><pdf_file_name>French Polynesia/PacELF_557.pdf</pdf_file_name><decade>1970</decade></rdsi.pacelf.phase3:document>
