There were significant differences in the severity of infection with these parasites between the two linguistic groups inhabiting the eastern and western halves of the island. Blood examinations for malaria and microfilariae also differed. It is thought that these differences reflect obscure microenvironmental factors in what would appear to be an epidemiologically homogeneous population.</description><year>1975</year><authors>Hornabrook, R.W., Kelly, A., McMillan, B.</authors><journal>American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene</journal><volume-issue>24(4)</volume-issue><pages>590-595</pages><work_location>Papua New Guinea</work_location><language>English</language><access_rights>Restricted</access_rights><pdf_file_name>Papua New Guinea/Hornabrook et al 1975 AJTMH Parasitic infections on Kar Kar PNG.pdf</pdf_file_name><decade>1970</decade></rdsi.pacelf.phase3:document>
