Laboratory tests indicated that F. reineckei was preferred by this mosquito for oviposition. Eggs were preferentially deposited on a peeled or a moist dried leaf. The percentage hatch was highest when eggs were kept moist for longer than 4 days before submersion. Hatching was complete in less than 6 h. These studies allowed us to successfully rear Oc. samoanus in the laboratory, facilitating future studies on the biology and control of this important vector.</description><year>2002</year><authors>Uchida, K., Ichimori, K., Paulson, G.S., Cox, P.A., Sone, F., Samarawickrema, W.A.</authors><journal>Journal of the American Mosquito Control Association</journal><volume-issue>18(2)</volume-issue><pages>81-85</pages><work_location>Samoa</work_location><language>English</language><access_rights>Open</access_rights><decade>2000</decade></rdsi.pacelf.phase3:document>
