We examined the role of group A streptococci in the progression of lymphedema in Polynesian patients with filariasis-related ADL (22 cases) or chronic pathology (10 cases), or with erysipela (10 patients) and, as controls, in 20 healthy adults. Antistreptolysin O (ASLO) and anti-streptodornase B (ASDB) titers were systematically determined in parallel to parasitological and biochemical tests. ASLO and ASDB assays were positive in 100 % of erysipela, 75 % of filarial ADL as compared ro 50 % of chronic pathology and 39 % of healthy controls. interestingly, by opposition to ASLO liters which were not significantly different between the four groups, ASDB titers were higher in ADL (p = 0.0101 and erysipela (p = 0.002) than in controls. These results support the hypothesis that recurrent streptococcal infections may have an important role in the pathogenesis of ADL in lymphatic filariasis.</description><year>2000</year><authors>Esterre, P., Plichart, C., Huin-Blondey, M.O., Nguyen, L.</authors><journal>Parasite</journal><volume-issue>7(2)</volume-issue><pages>91-94</pages><work_location>French Polynesia</work_location><language>English</language><access_rights>Restricted</access_rights><pdf_file_name>French Polynesia/Esterre et al 2000 PARASITE Role of strep in acute LF infection parasite2000072p91.pdf</pdf_file_name><decade>2000</decade></rdsi.pacelf.phase3:document>
