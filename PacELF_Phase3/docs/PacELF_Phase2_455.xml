Even with continued exposure to infection, all 19 had maintained their apparent infection-free status. Studies to define the mechanisms underlying this putative immunity revealed that cellular immune responses (including proliferation; generation of interleukin [IL]-2, IL-5, IL-10, interferon-gamma, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor) to adult- and microfilarial-stage antigens, but not antibody responses, were markedly greater than those of 20 age-matched, infected patients. Furthermore, the PI/EN group was comprised of high- and low-responding persons who were clinically indistinguishable. These findings provide evidence that protective immunity to lymphatic filariasis does occur and that it is probably T cell-mediated.</description><year>1996</year><authors>Steel, C., Guinea, A., Ottesen, E.A.</authors><journal>Journal of Infectious Diseases</journal><volume-issue>174(3)</volume-issue><pages>598-605</pages><work_location>Cook Islands</work_location><language>English</language><access_rights>Restricted</access_rights><decade>1990</decade></rdsi.pacelf.phase3:document>
