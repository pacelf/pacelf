At the village of Yauatong, indoor-resting Anopheles punctulatus had an infection rate of 47.3% and an infective rate of 3.4%. No infections occurred in 382 Culex annulirostris obtained in night-landing catches. At the village of Yankok only An. koliensis contained infective larvae but An. punctulatus and Cx quinquefasciatus were infected. Probit values of the cumulative percentages of filariae-positive mosquitoes plotted against the logarithm of the corresponding filaria count are illustrated.</description><year>1986</year><authors>Bryan, J.H.</authors><journal>Transactions of the Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene</journal><volume-issue>80(1)</volume-issue><pages>123-131</pages><work_location>Papua New Guinea</work_location><language>English</language><access_rights>Restricted</access_rights><pdf_file_name>Papua New Guinea/PacELF_495.pdf</pdf_file_name><decade>1980</decade></rdsi.pacelf.phase3:document>
