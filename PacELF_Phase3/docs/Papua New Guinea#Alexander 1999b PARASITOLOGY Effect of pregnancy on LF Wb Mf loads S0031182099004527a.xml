Mean levels generally increased with age in both sexes, with a tendency to plateau at the highest ages. However, there was a reduction among women of approximately reproductive age. Allowing for the tendency for aggregation to decrease with age, this reduction was statistically significant. However, a comparison of pregnant women and controls showed no evidence that the reduction is specifically related to pregnancy. Moreover, a simple differential equation model of microfilarial acquisition and loss suggests that age-specific patterns of exposure are also unlikely to be solely responsible. Therefore, we suggest that the observed reduction in microfilarial intensity may result from hormonal changes associated with female reproduction, possibly in combination with other factors.</description><year>1999</year><authors>Alexander, N.D.E., Grenfell, B.T.</authors><journal>Parasitology</journal><volume-issue>119</volume-issue><pages>151-156</pages><work_location>Papua New Guinea</work_location><language>English</language><access_rights>Restricted</access_rights><pdf_file_name>Papua New Guinea/Alexander 1999b PARASITOLOGY Effect of pregnancy on LF Wb Mf loads S0031182099004527a.pdf</pdf_file_name><decade>1990</decade></rdsi.pacelf.phase3:document>
