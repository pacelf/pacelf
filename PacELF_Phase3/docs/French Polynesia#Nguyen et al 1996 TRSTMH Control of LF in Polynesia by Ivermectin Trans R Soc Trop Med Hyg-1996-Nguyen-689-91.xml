All consenting inhabitants aged 3 years or more were treated with twice-yearly single doses of ivermectin, pregnant women excepted. A dosage of 100 microgram/kg was used for the 3 first treatments and then abandoned because it did not reduce the prevalence of microfilariae (mf) carriers. With a dosage of 400 micrograms/kg dosage, this prevalence decreased dramatically from 21% to 7%, and the mf level in carriers dropped to only 0.5% of its initial value after 3 treatments. The 400 micrograms/kg dosage was well tolerated and compliance was excellent. The twice-yearly single dose strategy with ivermectin at 400 micrograms/kg is safe and highly effective for filariasis control in an endemic area.</description><year>1996</year><authors>Nguyen, N.L., Moulia-Pelat, J.P., Cartel, J.L.</authors><journal>Transactions of the Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene</journal><volume-issue>90</volume-issue><pages>689-691</pages><work_location>French Polynesia</work_location><language>English</language><access_rights>Restricted</access_rights><pdf_file_name>French Polynesia/Nguyen et al 1996 TRSTMH Control of LF in Polynesia by Ivermectin Trans R Soc Trop Med Hyg-1996-Nguyen-689-91.pdf</pdf_file_name><decade>1990</decade></rdsi.pacelf.phase3:document>
