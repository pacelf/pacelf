Thirty adult Haitians with microfilaremia were treated with 1 mg of ivermectin to reduce counts of microfilariae. Later, subjects were treated with either one or two 200 Î¼g/kg doses of ivermectin or with 12 daily 6 mg/kg doses of DEC. Macrofilaricidal activity of these drugs was indirectly monitored by measuring circulating W. bancrofti antigen by EIA. Antigen levels fell by 75% after DEC and by 34% after ivermectin. These results suggest that low-dose ivermectin treatment followed by a standard course of DEC is a more effective macrofilaricidal regimen for W. bancrofti than either of the multidose ivermectin regimens used in this study.</description><year>1991</year><authors>Weil, G.J., Lammie, P.J., Richards Jr., F.O., Eberhard, M.L.</authors><journal>Journal of Infectious Diseases</journal><volume-issue>164(4)</volume-issue><pages>814-816</pages><work_location>Multicountry Global</work_location><language>English</language><access_rights>Restricted</access_rights><decade>1990</decade></rdsi.pacelf.phase3:document>
