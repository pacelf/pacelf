In anopheline mosquitoes, the Plasmodium falciparum sporozoite antigen positivity rate, filarial infection rates and human blood indices dropped significantly after bed nets were introduced. This reduction in human-vector contact did not affect mosquito density as no significant difference in either landing rates or indoor resting catches was found. The number of bed nets in a house and ownership of dogs were factors significantly associated with a reduction in the number of indoor resting mosquitoes. However, the reduction in the P. falciparum sporozoite antigen rate in mosquitoes was not accompanied by a reduction in either malaria parasite or antibody prevalences or titres against the P. falciparum circumsporozoite protein.</description><year>1990</year><authors>Burkot, T.R., Ganer, P., Paru, R., Dagoro, H., Bames, A., McDougall, S., Wirtz, R.A., Campbell, G., Spark, R.</authors><journal>Transactions of the Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene</journal><volume-issue>84(6)</volume-issue><pages>773-779</pages><work_location>Papua New Guinea</work_location><language>English</language><access_rights>Restricted</access_rights><pdf_file_name>Papua New Guinea/</pdf_file_name><decade>1990</decade></rdsi.pacelf.phase3:document>
