Transplacental passage occurred in five. Parasites were identified in one infant. The low parasitaemia in cord blood suggests that passage is accidental and probably occurs in labour. Where parasite transfer occurred there was no evidence of clinical illness in the newborn child. There were three stillborn infants and three infants of low birth weight. This small study confirms that the placenta provides an effective barrier during malaria in pregnancy.</description><year>1983</year><authors>Marshall, D.E.</authors><journal>Transactions of the Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene</journal><volume-issue>77(4)</volume-issue><pages>470-473</pages><work_location>Solomon Islands</work_location><language>English</language><access_rights>Restricted</access_rights><decade>1980</decade></rdsi.pacelf.phase3:document>
