In some of these countries, recent evidence suggests that transmission may have been interrupted. This document 1) outlines a proposed process for international verification of the interruption of transmission of lymphatic filariasis from formerly-endemic countries; and 2) provides a proposed format for the dossier that must be submitted by the Ministry of Health (MoH) of formerly-endemic countries to request official verification from WHO.</description><year>2017</year><pages>6</pages><work_location>Multicountry Global</work_location><language>English</language><access_rights>Open</access_rights><pdf_file_name>Multicountry Pacific\Guidelines and strategic plans/PacELF_1092 Draft_dossier_contents-june9.pdf</pdf_file_name><decade>2010</decade></rdsi.pacelf.phase3:document>
