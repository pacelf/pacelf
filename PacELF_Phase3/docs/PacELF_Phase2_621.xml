The effect of the drug was evaluated before and after each campaign by conducting four blood surveys covering 9600 to 13 700 people from 26-34 villages on each occasion. The drug reduced the prevalence of Wuchereria bancrofti microfilariae from 5.6% to 2.5% (a 55% reduction), while the transmission potential (the estimated mosquito infection rate if everyone is equally exposed to mosquito bites) dropped from 2.18 to 0.67 (a 70% reduction). The total number of microfilariae in the Samoan population is estimated to have been reduced by 80%. A spaced, single-dose treatment with DEC at a 1-2-year interval therefore seems to be an effective control measure against diurnally subperiodic W. bancrofti.</description><year>1992</year><authors>Kimura, E., Spears, G.F.S., Singh, K.I., Samarawickrema, W.A., Penaia, L., Sone, P.F., Pelenatu, S., Faaiuaso, S.T., Self, L.S., Dazo, B.C.</authors><journal>Bulletin of the World Health Organization</journal><volume-issue>70(6)</volume-issue><pages>769-776</pages><work_location>Samoa</work_location><language>English</language><access_rights>Restricted</access_rights><decade>1990</decade></rdsi.pacelf.phase3:document>
