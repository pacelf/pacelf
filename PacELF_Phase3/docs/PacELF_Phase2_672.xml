Here, we describe a multiplex tool for the sensitive detection of antibody responses to NTDs as well as vaccine preventable diseases, malaria, and waterborne and zoonotic infections. The assay platform is robust, can be performed with either serum or dried blood spots and can be adapted to local epidemiological conditions and public health priorities. Multiplex assays open the door to conducting routine serosurveillance for NTDs through demographic health surveillance or malaria indicator surveys.</description><year>2012</year><authors>Lammie, P.J., Moss, D.M., Brook Goodhew, E., Hamlin, K., Krolewiecki, A., West, S.K., Priest, J.W.</authors><journal>International Journal for Parasitology</journal><volume-issue>42(9)</volume-issue><pages>797-800</pages><work_location>Multicountry Global</work_location><language>English</language><access_rights>Restricted</access_rights><decade>2010</decade></rdsi.pacelf.phase3:document>
