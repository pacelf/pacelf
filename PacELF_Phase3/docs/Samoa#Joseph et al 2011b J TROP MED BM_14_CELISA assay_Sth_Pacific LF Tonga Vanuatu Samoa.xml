This research assessed the feasibility of CFA and antibody testing in three countries; Tonga, Vanuatu, and Samoa. Transmission is interrupted in Vanuatu and Tonga as evidenced by no CFA positive children and a low antibody prevalence and titre. Transmission is ongoing in Samoa with microfilaraemic (Mf) and CFA positive children and a high antibody prevalence and titre. Furthermore, areas of transmission were identified with Mf positive adults, but no CFA positive children. These areas had a high antibody prevalence in children. In conclusion, CFA testing in children alone was not useful for identifying areas of residual endemicity in Samoa. Thus, it would be beneficial to include antibody serology in the PICT surveillance strategy.</description><year>2011</year><authors>Joseph, H., Maiava, F., Naseri, T., Taleo, F., Ake, M., Capuano, C., Melrose, W.</authors><journal>Journal of Tropical Medicine</journal><volume-issue>2011</volume-issue><pages>e492023</pages><work_location>Samoa</work_location><language>English</language><access_rights>Open</access_rights><pdf_file_name>Samoa/Joseph et al 2011b J TROP MED BM_14_CELISA assay_Sth_Pacific LF Tonga Vanuatu Samoa.pdf</pdf_file_name><decade>2010</decade></rdsi.pacelf.phase3:document>
