During the visit to the Solomon Islands in 1978 to collect members of the Aedes (Stegomyia) scutellaris complex, Ae. albopictus was found in large numbers on Guadalcanal and was also present in the Santa Cruz Islands. This species has been incriminated as a vector of dengue haemorrhagic fever.</description><year>1980</year><authors>Elliott, S.A.</authors><journal>Transactions of the Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene</journal><volume-issue>74(6)</volume-issue><pages>747-748</pages><work_location>Solomon Islands</work_location><language>English</language><access_rights>Restricted</access_rights><decade>1980</decade></rdsi.pacelf.phase3:document>
