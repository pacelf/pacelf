Amongst those evaluated for mf levels (by Nucleporea filtration of 1 mL of night blood samples) were 288 children aged 4-10 years, the mothers of 26 1 of them and the fathers of 2 10. Analysis of mf status among these groups using Mantel- Haenszel x2 statistics and Cornfield confidence intervals (Epi Info version 6, Centers for Disease Control, Atlanta, Georgia, USA) showed that both children of mf+ mothers and those of mf+ fathers had a higher risk of being mf+ compared with offspring of mf- parents.</description><year>1998</year><authors>Alexander, N.D.E., Kazura, J.W., Bockarie, M.J., Perry, R.T., Dimber, Z.B., Grenfell, B.T., Alpers, M.P.</authors><journal>Transactions of the Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene</journal><volume-issue>92(1)</volume-issue><pages>23-24</pages><work_location>Papua New Guinea</work_location><language>English</language><access_rights>Restricted</access_rights><pdf_file_name>Papua New Guinea/Alexander et al 1998a TRSTMH Parental infection confounded wiht local infection intensity PNG LF Trans R Soc Trop Med Hyg-1998-Alexander-23-4.pdf</pdf_file_name><decade>1990</decade></rdsi.pacelf.phase3:document>
