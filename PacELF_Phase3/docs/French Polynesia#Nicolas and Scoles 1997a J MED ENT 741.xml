A multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay was designed to screen pools of field-collected Ae. polynesiensis for the presence of both parasites simultaneously using primers specific for each parasite. The sensitivity of detection on purified DNA was 1 and 10 pg, equivalent to 0.1 and 1 L3 larva per pool for W. bancrofti and D. immitis, respectively. Codetection was performed at an hybridization temperature of 58 degrees C to avoid competition between heterologous DNA and primers that was observed at 55 degrees C. In addition, D. immitis was detected by PCR in the blood of infected dogs.</description><year>1997</year><authors>Nicolas, L., Scoles, G.A.</authors><journal>Journal of Medical Entomology</journal><volume-issue>34(6)</volume-issue><pages>741-744</pages><work_location>French Polynesia</work_location><language>English</language><access_rights>Restricted</access_rights><pdf_file_name>French Polynesia/Nicolas and Scoles 1997a J MED ENT 741.pdf</pdf_file_name><decade>1990</decade></rdsi.pacelf.phase3:document>
