The Strategic Plan of 199 [sic] identified four major elements of the GPELF and two aims: the interruption of transmission and the prevention of disability. This Strategic Plan for 2003–2005 for scaling up is exclusively programmatic and assumes the availability of adequate funding for GPELF. Detailed planning for the acquisition of funding is being done by the Alliance Task Force on Advocacy and Fundraising.</description><year>2004</year><authors>World Health Organization</authors><pages>26</pages><work_location>Multicountry Global</work_location><language>English</language><publisher>World Health Organization</publisher><access_rights>Freely available from publisher website</access_rights><pdf_file_name>MULTICOUNTRY Global/PacELF_2739.pdf</pdf_file_name><decade>2000</decade></rdsi.pacelf.phase3:document>
