Accurate detection of Wuchereria bancrofti (Wb) microfilaria (mf) is essential to measure the impact of community treatment programmes. PCR-based assays are specific, highly sensitive tools allowing the detection of Wuchereria bancrofti DNA in human blood samples. However, current protocols describing the pool screening approach, use samples of less than 60 mu l of blood, which limits the sensitivity of the pool-screen PCR assay. The purpose of this study was to improve the pool-screen PCR protocol to enhance its sensitivity and usefulness for population scale studies.</description><year>2013</year><authors>Plichart, C., Lemoine, A.</authors><journal>Parasites and Vectors</journal><volume-issue>6</volume-issue><pages>e110</pages><work_location>French Polynesia</work_location><language>English</language><access_rights>Open</access_rights><pdf_file_name>French Polynesia/Plichart and Lemoine 2013 PARASIT VECTORS PCR blood spots Wb 1756-3305-6-110.pdf</pdf_file_name><decade>2010</decade></rdsi.pacelf.phase3:document>
