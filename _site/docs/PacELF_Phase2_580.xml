As an aid to workers in areas where Wuchereria and Plasmodium infections co-exist, he also provides a list of anophelines as filarial vectors, including in this list the results of natural and experimental studies of Wuchereria infection both alone and in combination with malaria.</description><year>1961</year><authors>Raghavan, N.G.</authors><journal>Bulletin of the World Health Organization</journal><volume-issue>24</volume-issue><pages>177-195</pages><work_location>Multicountry Global</work_location><language>English</language><access_rights>Open</access_rights><decade>1960</decade></rdsi.pacelf.phase3:document>
