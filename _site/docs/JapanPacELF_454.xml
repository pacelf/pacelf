Of particular importance in this success was a close collaboration between primary research and public health efforts. Many Japanese researchers continue to study malaria, particularly the areas of genetics and immunology, and this should contribute to global parasite eradication strategies. Furthermore, studies of immunoregulation of nematode infection using the interleukin-18 pathway, most of which have been conducted in Japan, are helping to improve researchers' understanding of human immune mechanisms and host-parasite interactions.</description><year>2007</year><authors>Arizono, N., Nakanihsi, K., Horii, T., Tanabe, K.</authors><journal>Trends in Parasitology</journal><volume-issue>23(4)</volume-issue><pages>175-181</pages><work_location>Japan</work_location><language>English</language><access_rights>Restricted</access_rights><pdf_file_name>Japan/PacELF_454.pdf</pdf_file_name><decade>2000</decade></rdsi.pacelf.phase3:document>
