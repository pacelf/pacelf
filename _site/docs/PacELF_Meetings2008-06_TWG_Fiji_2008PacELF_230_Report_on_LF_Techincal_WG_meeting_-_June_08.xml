Four of these countries have reached the elimination target of less than 1% LF antigenemia prevalence, and significant progress towards elimination has been made in at least five other countries. In June 2008, the Pacific Program to Eliminate LF held its first Technical Working Group (TWG) meeting in Nadi, Fiji. The meeting was attended by temporary advisors from the Pacific, international experts and the WHO. The TWG meeting followed on from recommendations made in 2007 to conduct technically strong surveys in a number of countries. The data from these surveys guided the discussions of the TWG in identifying and addressing technical issues and developing country action plans for the next three years. These outcomes were achieved through a combination of presentations from the participants and group work.</description><year>2008</year><authors>Western Health Organisation Western Pacific Region</authors><pages>77</pages><work_location>Multicountry Pacific</work_location><language>English</language><access_rights>Open</access_rights><pdf_file_name>PacELF Meetings\2008-06 TWG Fiji 2008/PacELF_230 Report on LF Techincal WG meeting - June 08.pdf</pdf_file_name><decade>2000</decade></rdsi.pacelf.phase3:document>
