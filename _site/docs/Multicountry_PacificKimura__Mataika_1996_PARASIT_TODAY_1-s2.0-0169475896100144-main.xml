However, recent studies revealed that only a single dose at 6 mg kg(-1) could reduce microfilaria (Mf) counts by 90%, and that the effect would persist for 12-18 months. The annual repeat of the single-dose mass treatment was shown to be effective in reducing Mf prevalence and density in large-scale, long-term field trials. The scheme is simple and economic, and could be sustainable in many endemic areas, where health manpower and resources are often not sufficient. Annual single-dose mass treatments can be an effective weapon against human lymphatic filariasis, as discussed here by Eisaku Kimura and Jona Mataika.</description><year>1996</year><authors>Kimura, E., Mataika, J.U.</authors><journal>Parasitology Today</journal><volume-issue>12(6)</volume-issue><pages>240-244</pages><work_location>Multicountry Pacific</work_location><language>English</language><access_rights>Restricted</access_rights><pdf_file_name>Multicountry Pacific/Kimura &amp; Mataika 1996 PARASIT TODAY 1-s2.0-0169475896100144-main.pdf</pdf_file_name><decade>1990</decade></rdsi.pacelf.phase3:document>
