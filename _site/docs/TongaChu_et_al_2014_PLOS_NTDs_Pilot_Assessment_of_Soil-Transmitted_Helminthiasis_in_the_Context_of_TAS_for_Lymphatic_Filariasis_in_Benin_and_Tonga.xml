A transmission assessment survey (TAS) is recommended to determine if MDA for LF can be stopped within an evaluation unit (EU) after at least five rounds of annual treatment. The TAS also provides an opportunity to simultaneously assess the impact of these MDAs on STH and to determine the frequency of school-based MDA for STH after community-wide MDA is no longer needed for LF.</description><year>2014</year><authors>Chu, B.K., Gass, K., Batcho, W., Ake, M., Dorkenoo, A.M., Adjinacou, E., Mafi, E., Addiss, D.G.</authors><journal>PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases</journal><volume-issue>8(2)</volume-issue><pages>e2708</pages><work_location>Tonga</work_location><language>English</language><access_rights>Open</access_rights><pdf_file_name>Tonga/Chu et al 2014 PLOS NTDs Pilot Assessment of Soil-Transmitted Helminthiasis in the Context of TAS for Lymphatic Filariasis in Benin and Tonga.pdf</pdf_file_name><decade>2010</decade></rdsi.pacelf.phase3:document>
