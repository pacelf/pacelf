Antigenemia was determined in 1322 persons by means of the Og4C3 antibody capture assay. Prevalence of antigenemia by village ranged from 61.7% to 98.2% and did not vary by sex. Antigen level increased with transmission potential among the 4 villages with measured transmission potential (r(2)=.945; P=.028). Antigenemia was associated positively with age in villages with the lowest annual transmission potentials (45 and 404 infective larvae/year; P&lt;.001), but was distributed evenly across age groups in villages with increased transmission (1485 and 2518 infective larvae/year). These data suggest that children and adults have similar worm burdens in areas of high transmission, whereas worm burdens in areas of lower transmission increase with age. These results may be useful in the design and evaluation of programs aimed at eliminating lymphatic filariasis.</description><year>2001</year><authors>Tisch, D.J., Hazlett, F.E., Kastens, W., Alpers, M.P., Bockarie, M.J., Kazura, J.W.</authors><journal>Journal of Infectious Diseases</journal><volume-issue>184(7)</volume-issue><pages>898-904</pages><work_location>Papua New Guinea</work_location><language>English</language><access_rights>Restricted</access_rights><decade>2000</decade></rdsi.pacelf.phase3:document>
