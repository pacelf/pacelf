These sera were from various groups of individuals, i.e., microfilaraemics, chronic patients, endemic normals, non-endemic normals and individuals with other parasitic and bacterial infections. Based on a cut-off optical density reading of 0·300, the IgG4 ELISA demonstrated specificity rates of 95·6-100%, sensitivity rates of 96-100%, positive predictive values of 75-100% and negative predictive values of 98·9-100%. These evaluation studies demonstrated the high specificity and sensitivity of this test for the detection of active B. malayi infection. Thus, the IgG4 ELISA would be very useful as a tool in diagnosis and in elimination programmes for brugian filariasis.</description><year>2001</year><authors>Rahmah, N., Lim, B.H., Khairul Anuar, A., Shenoy, R.K., Kumaraswami, V., Lokman Hakim, S., Chotechuang, P., Kanjanopas, K., Ramachandran, C.P.</authors><journal>Transactions of the Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene</journal><volume-issue>95(3)</volume-issue><pages>280-284</pages><work_location>Multicountry Global</work_location><language>English</language><access_rights>Restricted</access_rights><decade>2000</decade></rdsi.pacelf.phase3:document>
