Wild-caught Aedes polynesiensis were used to compare assessment of infection by dissection of individuals with the PCR assay of pools of mosquitoes. The PCR assay was at least as sensitivite as dissection for detection of mosquitoes infected with W. bancrofti.</description><year>1996</year><authors>Nicolas, L., Luquiaud, P., Lardeux, F., Mercer, D.R.</authors><journal>Transactions of the Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene</journal><volume-issue>90(2)</volume-issue><pages>136-139</pages><work_location>French Polynesia</work_location><language>English</language><access_rights>Open</access_rights><pdf_file_name>French Polynesia/PacELF_1418 Nicolas et al 1996 TRSTMH PCR for Ae. polynesiensis W bancrofti 90-2-136.pdf</pdf_file_name><decade>1990</decade></rdsi.pacelf.phase3:document>
