It was concluded that there was no clear evidence to support the existence of facilitation and facilitation-based unstable equilibrium in relation to microfilaria prevalence and density in human population below which filariasis would spontaneously disappear, even when the vector was Anopheles mosquitoes. Instead, the existence of a critical level of man/mosquito contacts for the disappearance of filariasis was suggested.</description><year>1995</year><authors>Wada, Y., Kimura, E., Takagi, M., Tsuda, Y.</authors><journal>Tropical Medicine and Parasitology</journal><volume-issue>46(1)</volume-issue><pages>27-30</pages><work_location>Multicountry Global</work_location><language>English</language><access_rights>Restricted</access_rights><decade>1990</decade></rdsi.pacelf.phase3:document>
