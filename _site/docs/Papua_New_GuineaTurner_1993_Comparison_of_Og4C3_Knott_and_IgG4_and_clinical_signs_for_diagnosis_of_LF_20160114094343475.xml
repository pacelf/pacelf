Both ELISA tests detected around twice the number of positive cases than those detected by the presence of microfilariae alone. No correlation was found with clinical signs and laboratory tests. This study raises concern over the underestimation of the prevalence of filariasis due to ineffective diagnostic criteria. The two ELISA tests should be of value in epidemiological surveys and for monitoring filariasis control programs.</description><year>1993</year><authors>Turner, P., Copeman, B., Gerisi, D., Speare, R.</authors><journal>Tropical Medicine and Parasitology</journal><volume-issue>44(1)</volume-issue><pages>45-48</pages><work_location>Papua New Guinea</work_location><language>English</language><access_rights>Restricted</access_rights><pdf_file_name>Papua New Guinea/Turner 1993 Comparison of Og4C3 Knott and IgG4 and clinical signs for diagnosis of LF 20160114094343475.pdf</pdf_file_name><decade>1990</decade></rdsi.pacelf.phase3:document>
