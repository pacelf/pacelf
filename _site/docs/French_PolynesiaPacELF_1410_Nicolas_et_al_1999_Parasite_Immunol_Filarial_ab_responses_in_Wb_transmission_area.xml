These groups likely reflect individuals with different permissivity/resistance to the complete development of W. bancrofti cycle. The profile of filarial-specific immunoglobulins was analysed in W. bancrofti-exposed individuals in French Polynesia, according to the presence or absence of microfilariae (Mf) and adult worms, measured by Og4C3 circulating antigen. Individuals harbouring adult worms, have higher filarial-specific IgG4 but lower IgG3 and IgE levels, than adult worm-free individuals, independently of the presence of Mf. Low filarial-specific IgG1 and IgG2 levels were associated with the presence of Mf but independent of the presence/absence of adult worms. The filarial antibody responses were associated with the parasitological status of individuals but not with clinical symptoms such as hydroceles or limb lymphangitis or elephantiasis. The reduction of filarial-specific immunoglobulin levels was higher after treatment with diethylcarbamazine, than ivermectin, which likely reflects the better effect of the former on W. bancrofti adult worms. However, reduction of antibody levels was also observed in Mf-and adult worm-negative individuals. This could be due to the overall reduction of W. bancrofti transmission in the island where this study took place.</description><year>1999</year><authors>Nicolas, L., Langy, S., Plichart, C., Deparis, X.</authors><journal>Parasite Immunology</journal><volume-issue>21(2)</volume-issue><pages>73-80</pages><work_location>French Polynesia</work_location><language>English</language><access_rights>Restricted</access_rights><pdf_file_name>French Polynesia/PacELF_1410 Nicolas et al 1999 Parasite Immunol Filarial ab responses in Wb transmission area.pdf</pdf_file_name><decade>1990</decade></rdsi.pacelf.phase3:document>
