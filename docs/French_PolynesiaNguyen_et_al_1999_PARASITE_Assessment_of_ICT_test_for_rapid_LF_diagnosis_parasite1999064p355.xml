The aim of this study was to assess the performance and usefulness of this antigen capture assay as a diagnostic method in three foci of lymphatic filariasis, located in the South Pacific (Society archipelago, French Polynesia), with different levels of endemicity. A sample of 1,595 patients was tested with this assay in parallel with a reference Og4C3 antigen capture assay and microfilariae detection. A second-generation ICT test, available for whole blood analysis, was also tested in parallel with the first generation test, developed for serum analysis, on a sample of 50 reference cases. The correspondence between the results obtained with the two rapid tests was excellent, without any influence of rheumatoid factors, but the sensitivity was in both cases slightly inferior to the one obtained with the ELISA reference test. This seems particularly true in epidemiological situation where a high proportion of amicrofilaraemic, adult worm carriers are observed.</description><year>1999</year><authors>Nguyen, N.L., Plichart, C., Esterre, P.</authors><journal>Parasite</journal><volume-issue>6(4)</volume-issue><pages>355-358</pages><work_location>French Polynesia</work_location><language>English</language><access_rights>Restricted</access_rights><pdf_file_name>French Polynesia/Nguyen et al 1999 PARASITE Assessment of ICT test for rapid LF diagnosis parasite1999064p355.pdf</pdf_file_name><decade>1990</decade></rdsi.pacelf.phase3:document>
