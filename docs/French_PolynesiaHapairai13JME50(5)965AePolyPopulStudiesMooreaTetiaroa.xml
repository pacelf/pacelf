Aedes polynesiensis recapture rate was high for females and low for males. The distribution of Aedes species in the valley was heterogeneous. Marked individuals dispersed to most parts of the motu and over great distances in the valley for some females. The study provides insights into the field dynamics of Ae. polynesiensis populations and confirms that more efficient sampling methods are warranted. There was no evidence of active migration between motus on the atoll, suggesting that Tetiaroa is a suitable site for small-scale initial open releases of Wolbachia incompatible insect technique and other sterile insect technique-like suppression or replacement strategies.</description><year>2013</year><authors>Hapairai, L.K., Sang, M.A.C., Sinkins, S.P., Bossin, H.C.</authors><journal>Journal of Medical Entomology</journal><volume-issue>50(5)</volume-issue><pages>965-976</pages><work_location>French Polynesia</work_location><language>English</language><access_rights>Restricted</access_rights><pdf_file_name>French Polynesia/Hapairai13JME50(5)965AePolyPopulStudiesMooreaTetiaroa.pdf</pdf_file_name><decade>2010</decade></rdsi.pacelf.phase3:document>
