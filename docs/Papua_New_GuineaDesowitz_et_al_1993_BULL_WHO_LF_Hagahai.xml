Children aged > 15 years had significantly fewer infections than adults and the microfilaraemia densities were considerably lower. Two subjects exhibited matutinal microfilarial periodicity, peaking at approximately 06 h 00. The possible reasons for the epidemiological and microfilarial findings are discussed.</description><year>1993</year><authors>Desowitz, R.S., Jenkins, C., Anian, G.</authors><journal>Bulletin of the World Health Organization</journal><volume-issue>71(1)</volume-issue><pages>55-58</pages><work_location>Papua New Guinea</work_location><language>English</language><access_rights>Restricted</access_rights><pdf_file_name>Papua New Guinea/Desowitz et al 1993 BULL WHO LF Hagahai.pdf</pdf_file_name><decade>1990</decade></rdsi.pacelf.phase3:document>
