Compared to the other villages, Fasitoo-Tai had a significantly higher Mf prevalence (3.2%), CFA prevalence (14.6%) and antibody prevalence in children (62.0%) (P&lt;0.05). Puapua had a significantly lower CFA prevalence (2.5%), no detectable Mf-positive individuals and significantly low antibody prevalence in children (7.9%) (P&lt;0.05). Siufaga, previously believed to be LF-free, recorded >1% CFA prevalence and a high antibody prevalence in children (46.6%). Overall, antibody prevalence in children appeared to reflect the transmission dynamics in the villages and, in Siufaga, identified an area of ongoing transmission. The Filariasis Cellabs Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (CELISA), based on recombinant antigen Bm14, to detect antibodies, could potentially be a promising diagnostic tool for inclusion in future surveillance in the South Pacific.</description><year>2011</year><authors>Joseph, H., Maiava, F., Naseri, T., Silva, U., Lammie, P., Melrose, W.</authors><journal>Annals of Tropical Medicine and Parasitology</journal><volume-issue>105(8)</volume-issue><pages>567-578</pages><work_location>Samoa</work_location><language>English</language><access_rights>Restricted</access_rights><pdf_file_name>Samoa/Joseph et al 2011a ATMP Epi assessment of LF Samoa.pdf</pdf_file_name><decade>2010</decade></rdsi.pacelf.phase3:document>
