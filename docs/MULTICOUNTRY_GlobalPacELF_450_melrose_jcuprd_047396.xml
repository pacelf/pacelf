The filariasis literature is voluminous and this review does not purport to cover all available material. An attempt has been made to cover all the most important aspects of filarial parasites and disease, and to include some of the more obscure and often forgotten material, some of which needs to be revisited in the light of modern filariology.</description><year>2004</year><authors>Melrose, W.</authors><pages>83</pages><work_location>Multicountry Global</work_location><language>English</language><publisher>Warwick Educational Publishing</publisher><access_rights>Open</access_rights><pdf_file_name>MULTICOUNTRY Global/PacELF_450 melrose jcuprd_047396.pdf</pdf_file_name><decade>2000</decade></rdsi.pacelf.phase3:document>
