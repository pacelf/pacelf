Despite tremendous progress in the approach to their diagnosis, epidemiology, and treatment, and global campaigns for their control and/or elimination, their global burden and economic costs have continued to rise. In most rural areas of the tropics, both diseases co-occur in the same human population and share common mosquito vectors. It is therefore conceived that control of the two diseases can be integrated using tools that have been proven effective recently or in the past. Before implementation of control programs in areas co-endemic for both diseases, it is deemed necessary to understand how the two diseases interact in the vector and human hosts. Here, we summarize available knowledge on coinfections of malaria and LF and provide an insight on how they can be managed.</description><year>2008</year><authors>Muturi, E.J., Jacob, B.G., Kim, C.-H., Mbogo, C.M., Novak, R.J.</authors><journal>Parasitology Research</journal><volume-issue>102(2)</volume-issue><pages>175-181</pages><work_location>Multicountry Global</work_location><language>English</language><access_rights>Restricted</access_rights><pdf_file_name>MULTICOUNTRY Global/Muturi et al 2008 Parasitol Res Coinfectons.pdf</pdf_file_name><decade>2000</decade></rdsi.pacelf.phase3:document>
