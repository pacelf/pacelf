Follow-up surveys were conducted in 2001, 2003, and 2006, using convenience samples of residents of sentinel villages. Antigenemia prevalence in 2001 (11.5%) and 2003 (13.5%) showed no change. After the 2003 sentinel assessment, improvements were made in the social mobilization and drug distribution strategies. In 2006, after a total of 5 years of MDA and 3 years of improved MDA participation, the antigenemia prevalence dropped from 11.5% (2001) to 0.95% (2006) (P &lt; 0.0001). In 2006, antigenemia prevalence was greater in males (1.5%) than females (0.4%) (P = 0.04). The decline in antigenemia prevalence shows the effectiveness of MDA and changes made in social mobilization and drug distribution.</description><year>2008</year><authors>Liang, J.L., King, J.D., Ichimori, K., Handzel, T., Pa'au, M., Lammie, P.J.</authors><journal>American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene</journal><volume-issue>78(6)</volume-issue><pages>924-928</pages><work_location>American Samoa</work_location><language>English</language><access_rights>Restricted</access_rights><pdf_file_name>American Samoa/PacELF_790 Liang et al 2008 AJTMH Impact of 5 rounds of MDA American Samoa 924.pdf</pdf_file_name><decade>2000</decade></rdsi.pacelf.phase3:document>
