In an area of Choiseul island first surveyed by the author in 1970, three follow-up surveys were conducted--in 1974, 1975 and 1976. These showed a progressive decrease in persons infected. When the densities, especially the median microfilarial counts, were expressed as percentage values of the pre-spray survey, there was found to be a proportional decrease over eight years. It is possible that the Anopheline vector needs to be reduced less for the cessation of transmission of filariasis than for malaria. A theoretical ratio was calculated and supporting field evidence presented.</description><year>1977</year><authors>Webber, R.H.</authors><journal>Transactions of the Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene</journal><volume-issue>71(5)</volume-issue><pages>396-400</pages><work_location>Solomon Islands</work_location><language>English</language><access_rights>Restricted</access_rights><pdf_file_name>Solomon Islands/Webber 1977 TRSTMH Solomon Is delcine wuchereria bancrofti.pdf</pdf_file_name><decade>1970</decade></rdsi.pacelf.phase3:document>
