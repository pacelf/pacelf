In 2001, nine countries and territories covered by the programme had begun annual MDA campaigns, with population treatment coverages ranging from 52% to 95%. By the end of 2002, it is anticipated that 11 countries/territories will have begun such MDA campaigns. Even with high MDA coverage, the efficiency of Aedes polynesiensis as a vector of Wuchereria bancrofti may limit the effectiveness of the elimination campaigns in some countries. In areas of limited MDA coverage, additional strategies, such as vector control (as a adjunct to the MDA), or alternative approaches, such as the use of DEC-fortified salt, may be necessary to stop transmission.</description><year>2002</year><authors>Burkot, T.R., Taleo, G., Toeaso, V., Ichimori, K.</authors><journal>Annals of Tropical Medicine and Parasitology</journal><volume-issue>96 (SUPPL. 2)</volume-issue><pages>S61-69</pages><work_location>Multicountry Pacific</work_location><language>English</language><access_rights>Restricted</access_rights><pdf_file_name>Multicountry Pacific/PacELF_509 Burkot et al 2002 ATMP Progress towards and challenges for elimination paper Ann Trop Med Parasit.pdf</pdf_file_name><decade>2000</decade></rdsi.pacelf.phase3:document>
