In the 4 indicator villages, the infection rate in Ae. polynesiensis was 0.46% and the infective rate 0.09% (15 223 mosquitoes were dissected). The infection rate in Ae. samoanus was 0.20% and the infective rate 0.08% (10 089 dissected). In 45 selected villages throughout the country, Ae. polynesiensis infection and infective rates were 0.92% and 0.29% (7575 dissected) and the rates for Ae. samoanus were 0.21% and 0.07% (9093 dissected). Infection with D. immitis was comparable in degree and distribution to that with W. bancrofti. There was a steady and consistent exchange of parasites between the human and canine populations, creating conditions favourable for human dirofilariasis in Samoa. Clinicians are warned against this probable human infection.</description><year>1992</year><authors>Samarawickrema, W.A., Kimura, E., Sones, F., Paulson, G.S., Cummings, R.F.</authors><journal>Transactions of the Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene</journal><volume-issue>86(2)</volume-issue><pages>187-188</pages><work_location>Samoa</work_location><language>English</language><access_rights>Restricted</access_rights><decade>1990</decade></rdsi.pacelf.phase3:document>
