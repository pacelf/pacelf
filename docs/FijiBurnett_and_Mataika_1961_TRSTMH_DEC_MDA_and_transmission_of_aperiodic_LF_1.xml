Two courses of drug were given to everyone, of approximately 6 mg. per kg. per dose, six doses being given at weekly intervals; 1,226 people completed the first course, 911 the second. The mean microfilarial infection rate was reduced from 12.2 per cent. to 2.7 per cent., five months after the end of the second course, and the mean microfilarial density from 4.048 to 0.360, reductions of 79 per cent. and 91.1 per cent. There was a considerable movement of people in and out of the area, which reduced the apparent effect of the drug. Reductions in m.f.r. and m.f.d. for people found positive were 65 per cent. and 96.24 per cent. for one course (127 subjects) and 92 per cent. and 99.76 per cent. for two (89 subjects). Transmission of filariasis may have ceased, no mature infections being found in the vector species after medication of the people.</description><year>1961</year><authors>Burnett, G.F., Mataika, J.U.</authors><journal>Transactions of the Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene</journal><volume-issue>55(2)</volume-issue><pages>178-187</pages><work_location>Fiji</work_location><language>English</language><access_rights>Restricted</access_rights><pdf_file_name>Fiji/Burnett and Mataika 1961 TRSTMH DEC MDA and transmission of aperiodic LF 1.pdf</pdf_file_name><decade>1960</decade></rdsi.pacelf.phase3:document>
