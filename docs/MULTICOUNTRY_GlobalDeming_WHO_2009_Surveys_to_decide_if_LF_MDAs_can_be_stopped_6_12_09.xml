The final step in this algorithm is a survey of the prevalence of filarial antigenemia among school entrants using lot quality assurance sampling (LQAS). MDAs are stopped only if the survey demonstrates statistically that antigenemia prevalence is &lt;0.1%. The guidelines for the LQAS survey are to select a systematic sample of 3000 school entrants and to conclude that MDAs can be stopped only if no child is among the 3000 is found to be antigenemic. In August 2008, a meeting convened by the World Health Organization (WHO) on when to stop MDAs made recommendations for changing the antigenemia survey guidelines in the 2005 manual.2 The recommendations are summarized below as well as the modifications of these recommendations agreed on in subsequent meetings.</description><year>2009</year><authors>Deming, M., Lee, H.</authors><pages>33</pages><work_location>Multicountry Global</work_location><language>English</language><access_rights>Restricted</access_rights><pdf_file_name>MULTICOUNTRY Global/Deming WHO 2009 Surveys to decide if LF MDAs can be stopped 6_12_09.pdf</pdf_file_name><decade>2000</decade></rdsi.pacelf.phase3:document>
