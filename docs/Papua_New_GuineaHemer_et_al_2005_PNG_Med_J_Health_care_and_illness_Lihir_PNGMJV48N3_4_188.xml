The review aim was to document the health care providers for the local population and the illness burden suffered by Lihirians, and then to shape services to have a more preventive emphasis. It was discovered that the health care services available were well utilized by Lihirians. Health care was provided by the church, government and the mining company, and needed better coordination of services. Lihirians faced a relatively heavy burden of illness, with malaria the most common affliction. They also suffered significantly from lymphatic filariasis and tuberculosis, and children were poorly nourished. A considerable number of recommendations have been adopted since the health review to improve the health of, and delivery of health services to Lihirians.</description><year>2005</year><authors>Hemer, S.R.</authors><journal>Papua and New Guinea Medical Journal</journal><volume-issue>48(3-4)</volume-issue><pages>188-195</pages><work_location>Papua New Guinea</work_location><language>English</language><access_rights>Restricted</access_rights><pdf_file_name>Papua New Guinea/Hemer et al 2005 PNG Med J Health care and illness Lihir PNGMJV48N3_4_188.pdf</pdf_file_name><decade>2000</decade></rdsi.pacelf.phase3:document>
