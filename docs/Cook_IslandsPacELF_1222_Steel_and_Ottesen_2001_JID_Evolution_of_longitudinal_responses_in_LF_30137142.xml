Eleven persons remained microfilaremic, whereas 18 had cleared both microfilaremia and antigenemia. Despite decreased infection on the island, antibody levels remained relatively constant for the subjects with persistent microfilaremia (Mf+/+), in contrast to sharp decreases for both EN subjects and subjects with cleared microfilaremia (Mf+/-). Although clinically indistinguishable from the EN subjects, the Mf+/- group had antibody levels (IgG, IgG4, and IgE) significantly lower than those of the EN subjects. Lymphocyte responses to parasite antigens were marginally greater in Mf+/- than in Mf+/+ subjects, but both groups remained less cell responsive (as measured by proliferation, interleukin-5, interleukin-10, interferon-Î³, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor) than did the EN subjects. These findings suggest that, for microfilaremic persons, complete clearance of infection is not sufficient to restore "normal" immune responsiveness; filarial infection may induce very long-term deficits in the ability to respond to parasite antigens</description><year>2001</year><authors>Steel, C., Ottesen, E.A.</authors><journal>Journal of Infectious Diseases</journal><volume-issue>184(1)</volume-issue><pages>73-79</pages><work_location>Cook Islands</work_location><language>English</language><access_rights>Restricted</access_rights><pdf_file_name>Cook Islands/PacELF_1222 Steel and Ottesen 2001 JID Evolution of longitudinal responses in LF 30137142.pdf</pdf_file_name><decade>2000</decade></rdsi.pacelf.phase3:document>
