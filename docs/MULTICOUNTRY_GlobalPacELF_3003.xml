He requested that the meeting decide whether guidance from the Global Programme to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis (GPELF) on mapping, monitoring and stopping mass drug administration (MDA) would need to change if the new test were implemented. The meeting had three objectives: 1) to recommend new or modified strategies to supplement mapping and delineate the endemicity of lymphatic filariasis (LF); 2) to develop recommendations on the programmatic use of the new Alere Filariasis Test Strip (FTS) if necessary, as determined by the presentation and discussion of results of the comparative studies; 3) and to determine what information should be included in the template for a dossier to be used to document the achievement of elimination targets.</description><year>2014</year><authors>World Health Organization</authors><pages>51</pages><work_location>Multicountry Global</work_location><language>English</language><publisher>World Health Organization</publisher><access_rights>Freely available from publisher website</access_rights><pdf_file_name>MULTICOUNTRY Global/PacELF_3003.pdf</pdf_file_name><decade>2010</decade></rdsi.pacelf.phase3:document>
