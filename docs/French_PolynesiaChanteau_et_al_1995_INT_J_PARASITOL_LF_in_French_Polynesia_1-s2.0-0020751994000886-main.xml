The prevalence rates for each of the 4 markers were clearly age dependent and their patterns strongly associated with the transmission level. The antigenemia prevalence rate was consistently higher than the microfilaremia prevalence rate, in all age groups. The prevalences of anti-B. malayi IgG and IgG4 responses were very similar and much higher than those of microfilaremia or antigenemia. Antibody responses reached the plateau at an earlier age and at a higher prevalence with increased intensity of transmission. For all the markers, the prevalence rates were significantly higher in males than in females.</description><year>1995</year><authors>Chanteau, S., Glaziou, P., Plichart, C., Luquiaud, P., Moulia-Pelat, J.P., N'Guyen, L., Cartel, J.L.</authors><journal>International Journal for Parasitology</journal><volume-issue>25(1)</volume-issue><pages>81-85</pages><work_location>French Polynesia</work_location><language>English</language><access_rights>Restricted</access_rights><pdf_file_name>French Polynesia/Chanteau et al 1995 INT J PARASITOL LF in French Polynesia 1-s2.0-0020751994000886-main.pdf</pdf_file_name><decade>1990</decade></rdsi.pacelf.phase3:document>
