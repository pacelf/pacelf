It presents evidence of the noteworthy impact and success achieved halfway through the programme, and points out the challenges that still remain. We hope that community leaders, field staff, programme managers, policy-making and planning officers, health professionals, scientists, and students interested in lymphatic filariasis elimination and disease control programmes in general will find this book useful in programme implementation, strategic planning and research. The world has much to learn from the lessons in international cooperation and management in the Pacific contained in this book. The PacELF Way shows that the people involved, their motivation and active participation, are the key to eliminating this communicable disease. PacELF owes its success to collaboration between small island countries separated by a vast ocean, working towards a common goal.</description><year>2006</year><authors>World Health Organization, Western Pacific Region</authors><pages>255</pages><work_location>Multicountry Pacific</work_location><language>English</language><publisher>World Health Organization</publisher><access_rights>Open</access_rights><pdf_file_name>Multicountry Pacific/PacELF_408 WHO WPRO 2006 The PacELF Way 9290612150_eng.pdf</pdf_file_name><decade>2000</decade></rdsi.pacelf.phase3:document>
