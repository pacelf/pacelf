The meeting also provided an opportunity to consider the possible role of monitoring filariasis prevalence in the human population via vector sampling and assays. The term xenomonitoring was introduced for this approach. The GPELF was launched in 2000, based on two strategies: stopping transmission and alleviation of disability due to the disease. Currently the GPELF depends largely on mass drug administration (MDA) to interrupt transmission of filaria parasites: Brugia and Wuchereria bancrofti. Integrated vector control activities and environmental sanitation are encouraged while national ELF programmes focus primarily on achieving high rates of MDA coverage.</description><year>2002</year><authors>World Health Organization</authors><pages>50</pages><work_location>Multicountry Global</work_location><language>English</language><publisher>World Health Organization</publisher><access_rights>Open</access_rights><pdf_file_name>MULTICOUNTRY Global/PacELF_2769.pdf</pdf_file_name><decade>2000</decade></rdsi.pacelf.phase3:document>
