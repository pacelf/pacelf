All positive blood films were from persons who had been away from endemic areas for 8 years or less. Microfilaria rates differed considerably from those in Samoa. Only a small fraction of the persons tested showed symptoms of filariasis. Although competent vectors are present, it is unlikely that the infection will be established in the United States. The prevalence of filariasis in Samoan immigrants can be expected to decline as a secondary effect of a control program in American Samoa.</description><year>1970</year><authors>Mahoney Jr., L.E., Aiu, P.</authors><journal>American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene</journal><volume-issue>19(4)</volume-issue><pages>629-631</pages><work_location>American Samoa</work_location><language>English</language><access_rights>Restricted</access_rights><pdf_file_name>American Samoa/Mahoney_Aiu 1970 AJTMH LF in Samoan immigrants to the US 629.pdf</pdf_file_name><decade>1970</decade></rdsi.pacelf.phase3:document>
