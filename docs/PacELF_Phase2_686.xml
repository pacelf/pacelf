Increased efforts are needed to expand global coverage. These efforts will involve national and international harmonisation and coordination of the activities of partnerships devoted to control or elimination of these diseases. Rational planning and integration into regular health systems is essential to scale up these interventions to achieve complete eradication of these diseases. Programmes with similar delivery strategies and interventions-such as those for onchocerciasis, lymphatic filariasis, and soil-transmitted helminthiasis-could be managed on the same platform and together. Furthermore, better-resourced programmes-such as those for malaria, HIV/AIDS, and tuberculosis-could work closely with those for neglected tropical diseases to their mutual benefit and the benefit of the entire health system.</description><year>2010</year><authors>Gyapong, J.O., Gyapong, M., Yellu, N., Anakwah, K., Amofah, G., Bockarie, M., Adjei, S.</authors><journal>The Lancet</journal><volume-issue>375(9709)</volume-issue><pages>160-165</pages><work_location>Multicountry Global</work_location><language>English</language><access_rights>Restricted</access_rights><decade>2010</decade></rdsi.pacelf.phase3:document>
