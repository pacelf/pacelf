Mathematical models of filariasis transmission can serve as an effective tool for guiding the scientific development and management of successful community-level intervention programmes by acting as analytical frameworks for integrating knowledge regarding parasite transmission dynamics with programmatic factors. However, the power of these tools for supporting control interventions will be realized fully only if researchers address the current uncertainties and gaps in data and knowledge of filarial population dynamics and the effectiveness of currently proposed filariasis intervention options.</description><year>2006</year><authors>Michael, E., Malecela-Lazaro, M.N., Kabali, C., Snow, L.C., Kazura, J.W.</authors><journal>Trends in Parasitology</journal><volume-issue>22(5)</volume-issue><pages>226-233</pages><work_location>Multicountry Pacific</work_location><language>English</language><access_rights>Open</access_rights><decade>2000</decade></rdsi.pacelf.phase3:document>
