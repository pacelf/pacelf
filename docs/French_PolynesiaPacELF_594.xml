The geometric mean titres were 22, 41, 147 and 605 respectively. Untreated microfilariae were unsuitable for diagnostic purposes. Dirofilaria immitis adult sections showed low reactivity, giving poor discrimination between non-endemic and microfilaraemic sera. The geometric mean titres were 6 and 61 respectively.</description><year>1986</year><authors>Chanteau, S., Guid, C., Durosoir, J.L.</authors><journal>Transactions of the Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene</journal><volume-issue>80(5)</volume-issue><pages>795-799</pages><work_location>French Polynesia</work_location><language>English</language><access_rights>Restricted</access_rights><pdf_file_name>French Polynesia/PacELF_594.pdf</pdf_file_name><decade>1980</decade></rdsi.pacelf.phase3:document>
